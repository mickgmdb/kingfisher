[features]
# Specialize the build of Vectorscan to use available SIMD instructions on the build system's CPU.
# This will result in binary that is not portable to other CPUs.
simd_specialization = ["vectorscan-rs-sys/simd_specialization"]

# Specialize the build of Vectorscan for the microarchitecture of the build system's CPU.
# This will result in binary that is not portable to other CPUs.
cpu_native = ["vectorscan-rs-sys/cpu_native"]

# Enable all features that can improve speed but break binary portability.
fast_nonportable = ["cpu_native", "simd_specialization"]

# This feature causes the Vectorscan unit test suite to be built and run at
# crate build time.
