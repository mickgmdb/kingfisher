[features]
# This feature causes `bindgen` to run to produce the raw Rust bindings to Vectorscan.
gen = ["bindgen"]

# This feature causes Vectorscan to build using available SIMD
# microarchitecture support from the build system CPU, such as AVX2, AVX512,
# SVE, and SVE2. The resulting binary will not be portable to CPUs that lack
# SIMD support that the build system has.
simd_specialization = []

# This feature causes Vectorscan to build with code tuned for the
# microarchitecture of the build system's CPU. The resulting binary will not be
# portable to CPUs that lack SIMD support that the build system has.
cpu_native = []

# This feature causes the Vectorscan unit test suite to be built and run at
# crate build time.

# This feature causes Vectorscan to build with address sanitizer enabled.
